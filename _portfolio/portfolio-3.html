## Deep G-Buffer

### From the paper: “Deep G-Buffer for stable global illumination approximation” (Mara, McGuire 2016)

Github: https://github.com/KareshiKraise/DeepGBuffer

- Implemented the layered buffers using Geometry Shaders
- Implemented the Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion method proposed by the paper as well, for further comparisons between SSAO techniques.
