## Vulkan Studies to learn the API while experimenting with possible 3D Renderer Designs using it.

Github: https://github.com/KareshiKraise/Vulkan_Studies
- Studies and experiments still in progress, based on SaschaWillems code samples, vulkan-tutorial and Graham Sellersâ€™ Official Vulkan Programming Guide.
- Currently designing a material system and experimenting with descriptors layout configuration.
- Eventually to becomea full port of my thesis (top of this document) to the Vulkan API.
