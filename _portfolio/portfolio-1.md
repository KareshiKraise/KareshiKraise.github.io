title: "Screen-Space VPL Propagation for indirect diffuse illumination"
excerpt: The project took approximately 3 years where I developed my take on a screen-space indirect lighting algorithm for diffuse inter-reflections. The project itself is composed of many different algorithms implemented from other famous papers and consists of multiple passes over the GPU rasterization pipeline.
