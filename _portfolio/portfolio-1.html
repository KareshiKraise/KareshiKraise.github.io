The project took approximately 3 years and I developed my take on a screen-space indirect lighting algorithm for diffuse inter-reflections.<br /> The project itself is composed of many different algorithms<br /> implemented from other famous papers and consists of multiple passes over the GPU rasterization pipeline.

- Shadow Maps 
- Reflective Shadow Maps,  importance sampled in a view adaptive manner based on Ritschel, 2009 
- Compute Shader Based K-means clustering of Virtual Point Lights
- Paraboloid Shadow Maps computed with geometry Shaders
- A general tone-mapping operator (Reinhart, 2012)
