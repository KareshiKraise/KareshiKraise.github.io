<p>The project took approximately 3 years and I developed my take on a screen-space indirect lighting algorithm for diffuse inter-reflections.<br /> The project itself is composed of many different algorithms<br /> implemented from other famous papers and consists of multiple passes over the GPU rasterization pipeline.</p>
