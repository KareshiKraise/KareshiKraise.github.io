[This page is still in development...]

Welcome to my space.

I'm Vítor, a Computer Graphics researcher (and developer) based in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
My interests in the field of CG are many, but primarily in Light Transport. In my 8 years of experience in software development I was able to acquire expertise in multiple fields, currently I'm employed as a research and development engineer at CIMATEC's High Performance Computing Center, where I developed strong skills in supercomputing, multiprocessor and multithreaded environments as well as data science and deep learning.

My hobbies are video games, drawing, playing guitar, working out and (ofc) computer graphics. I also teach japanese as a volunteer teacher at the Japanese Language School of Salvador (Bahia/Brazil).

Check my CV and Portfolio if you're interested in hiring me. :D
