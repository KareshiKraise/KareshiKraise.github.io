[This page is still in development...]

Welcome to my space.

I'm Vítor, a Computer Graphics researcher (and developer) based in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
My interests in the field of CG are many, but primarily in Light Transport. Currently employed as a research and development engineer at CIMATEC's High Performance Computing Center, I also have strong skills in multiprocessor and multithreaded environments, as well as supercomputers. I also have professional experience with Data Science and Deep Learning. 

My hobbies are video games, drawing, playing guitar, working out and (ofc) computer graphics. I also teach japanese as a volunteer teacher at the Japanese Language School of Salvador (Bahia/Brazil).
