Education
======
* B.S. Computer Engineering, 2013
* M.S. Computer Graphics, 2021

Work experience
======
* Current : Research and Development Engineer at High Performance Computing Center ( SENAI-CIMATEC)   
  * Code Optimization Projects (Under NDA): Developed low level code optimizations in C for multiprocessor and multi-threaded HPC environments for speed ups of up to 40%. Implemented genetic algorithms for parameter optimization. Built in-house framework for high performance GPGPU code in C and Cuda. Benchmarked both Fortran and C code with Intel VTUNE to find performance hotspots and detect data access patterns.
  * Artificial Intelligence Projects (under NDA): Developed univariate and multivariate neural network models for time-series prediction of log and sensor-data in Python with the Tensorflow and Keras API. Applied many feature-engineering and data-analysis techniques do optimize and deploy the final model. Developed in-house machine learning framework to improve productivity. 
  * Domain Specific Language (DSL) Project (under NDA): Took part in the development of new features in a Domain Specific Language framework geared towards exploration of oil in environments of high structural complexity. Developed code for multiprocessor, multi-core and multi-GPU High Performance Computing systems, with a focus on performance and fault tolerance.  

* Software Developer Experience (Freelancer, Contractor, Researcher):
  * Worked with 3D and 2D geometry processing for BIM (Building Information Modelling) applications in C# (Xbim Toolkit). Developed many polygonal mesh processing algorithms for shape collision, convex hull, contour detection and space partitioning.
  * Large experience implementing several Computer Graphics techniques such as, real-time fluid simulations, global illumination, order independent transparency algorithms in OpenGL for custom graphics engines and applications, polygon mesh processing and many others.
  * Participated on the development team of the FOSS game “Hero of Allacrost”, contributed to development and bug fixes of ingame screenshot tool.

* Japanese Language Teacher at Japanese Language School of Salvador (Voluntary)

*  Artclim Hospitalar Co-Owner - (2010 ~ 2017)
  *   Developed and maintained in-house inventory management software in Java and C++ to improve productivity and control over assets. Developed automation and support scripts and tools to assist in daily tasks of employees in Python.
